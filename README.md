(Q)Write a program to implement back propagation neural network classifier with given details
Input vector X =[x1(2), x2(3), x3(4)],
Hidden layer =1, Hidden nodes = 2 (h1, h2)
bias to h1 =b1 and bias to h2 = b2
Output vector Y = [y1(0), y2(1)]
Assume random weights W = [w1,w2, w3, w4, w5, w6,..., w10] in range [0-1]
Consider your network is fully connected
Learning rate = 0.1 and 0.5
Present a table of information of the weights adjustment for 10,000 iterations or when the error in consecutive iterations is less than 0.001 which one is early.
